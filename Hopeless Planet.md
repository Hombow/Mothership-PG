# Hopeless Planet

## Distress Signal from the planet
* Cycling through every waveband which creates the beeping
  * opening all of the wavebands will create a continous note
* Too noisy to know from where
  * Check to pinpoint location
    * If right, close enough to use ship as base
    * If wrong then will be more at risk
## Jumping
* If they try to jump away it will fail due to abort
  * The log will give out an abort due to calculation error
    * If investigated shows wildly incorrect math was used (incredibly difficult to understand)
  * slight damage to the jump drive, not enough to prevent further jumping, enough to need repairs
    * If continued jumping, then they'll encounter a jump drive malfunction  and eventually destory the ship
## Landing
* 
## Badness
* The light is dangerous, stay out of the light
  * 
## Monsters
* 
## Atmosphere
* Rumbling
* Lights turning on
* Impossibly loud noise
* The gods are here, and they are angry
